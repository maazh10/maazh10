Hi 👋 I'm Maaz
=====================

Full Stack Developer
--------------------

I am a recent computer science grad from the University of Toronto and a Junior Software Developer at Electric Mind. I have a keen interest in building innovative software and solving complex problems, particularly on the web. I have a broad range of school/professional experiences in data manipulation, automation, full-stack web development, dev-ops, as well as designing complex software architecture. I am extremely knowledge-driven, aspired by cutting-edge technologies, and I'm eager to grow and use my skills to change the world someday.
